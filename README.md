## Getting Started

### Setup Player

Shio uses the `SHIO_PLAYER_CMD` environment variable to launch your media player. Set it to your player of choice — **mpv** and **VLC** are recommended.

**mpv**
```sh
export SHIO_PLAYER_CMD="mpv --user-agent='{user_agent}' --http-header-fields='Referer: {referer}' '{url}'"
```

**VLC**
```sh
export SHIO_PLAYER_CMD="vlc --http-user-agent='{user_agent}' --http-referrer='{referer}' '{url}'"
```

> [!NOTE]
> `{url}` is required. `{user_agent}` and `{referer}` are only required for some hosts — but it's recommended to include them so all sources work correctly.
